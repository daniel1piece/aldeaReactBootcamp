        <h2>InuYasha</h2>
        <p>I still vividly remember the first time I accidentally stumbled into InuYasha. I couldn’t have been more than seven years old. I couldn’t sleep so I snuck out into the living room to watch TV. Unbeknownst to me, Cartoon Network had transitioned to its after-hours programming. With the quiet glow of the screen, I saw him for the first time. </p>
        <p>The image of the sword-swinging dog-eared boy with the silver locks embedded into my subconscious and was reawakened when I picked up a copy of the manga some years later — my introduction to the medium. This led to me reading all 56 volumes of the original manga and watching all 193 episodes of the anime series, all before I left elementary school. I successfully convinced all of my friends to join in on my obsession and I proudly served as one of the cultivators of anime and Japanese pop culture in my small hometown where the Asian population was less than five percent.</p>
